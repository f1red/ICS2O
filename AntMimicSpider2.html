		<h3>Biometrics are a form of security.</h3>
			<p>The term biometrics is the measurement of unique physical characteristics, for example fingerprints and facial features. The purpose is to verify identity of an individual. Biometric security effectively reduces the chance that someone can be impersonated or mistaken as someone else.<br><img src="https://blog.dashlane.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/10-Reasons-Why-Biometrics-Won%E2%80%99t-Replace-Passwords-Anytime-Soon.png" style="width: 750px"><br>This method is secure because your physical caracteristics are unique to you and only you; therefore, humans and computers cannot replicate this. Biometrics are being used mroe and more. Biometrics include finger print and facial identification. They are used in modern phones now. For example, iPhones include a fingerprint sensor. Some andriod devices include facial recognition.
