	<h1>Requirements for video game</h1>
		<p><center><b>***It is recommended to close all other applications and tabs to ensure optimal preformance and remember to scroll down all the way to see the whole game***</b></center></p>
		
		<h3>Instructions:</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Score as many times as possible in the net</li>
				<li>Scored pucks spawn at the centre of the arena but <b>will still move</b></li>
				<li>The game is over when <b>one</b> of your pucks falls out of the arena</li>
				<li>Your handle cannot pass the dark grey line (located at the top)</li>
				<li>hint: the ball always goes the same speed when hit by the handle, let the ball hit your handle instead</li>
			</ul>
		<h3>Function of the JavaScript</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>The handle and pucks will never pass the borders and the handle will never pass the dark grey line located near the top of the arena.</li>
				<li>The pucks do not collide with each other</li>
				<li>The pucks always start on the upper half of the arena, and head towards the bottom</li>
				<li>One point is awarded when you score in the net. The ball will then spawn at the centre of the arena and will bounce back and forth and descend slowly.</li>
				<li>The amount of force used to hit the pucks will not affect their speed</li>
				<li>There are 4 status of the game:</li>
					<ol>
						<li>Start Screen</li>
							<p>The title "Bounce Back" will appear in the middle of the screen in a large green "impact" font. Below this will be a hover over button that says "hover over for instructions", when your mouse is over this button, the instructions will appear. Below this button is the "start >" button, if this button is pressed, the game will start.</p>
						<li>Game</li>
							<p>The net will be in the top middle, with a half circle around it (the board should look like glow hockey). A dark grey line should be near the top of the arena which does not allow the handle to pass higher than that. The score will be shown at the top left of the arena. During this status, you should be able to press 'P' which allows you to pause the game.</p>
						<li>Pause</li>
							<p>The words "GAME PAUSED" will be in big green font in the middle of the screen. Underneath, "score : #" in blue font. The player has an option to resume the game with the button at the bottom middle that says "resume" in white font.</p>
						<li>End / Restart</li>
							<p>"GAME OVER" will be displayed in big green font, "You just took an L...", and the score will be displayed in the middle of the game in colors. Underneath all this will be a restart button, will clicked, it will bring the player back straight into the game.</p>
					</ol>
			</ul>
