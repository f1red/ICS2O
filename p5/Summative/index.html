	<h1>Requirements for video game</h1>
		<h3>Instructions:</h3>
			<p><b>The Goal:</b> keep the pucks in the board for as long as possible. The pucks will fall out of the board at the bottom (where the border does not exist), use your hockey stick to hit them back. The puck will only interact with the bottom of your stick ( the black part ). You can use your stick and hover over the ball to trap it in there, but becareful, it does not stay there forever and will escape! Good luck!.</p>
