	<h1>Requirements for video game</h1>
		<h3>Instructions:</h3>
			<p><b>***It is strongly recommended to close all other applications and tabs to ensure optimal preformance***</b>(for toasters)<br><b>The Goal:</b> Score the pucks into the red net at the top centre, the posts do not interact with the pucks (they are there for a visual). Your mouse will control the handle. Your handle cannot go pass the dark grey line near the top of the board. Each hit in the net counts as 1 (one) point, the ball will then be placed in the middle of the board and be bouncing back and forth sideways. You have two pucks, and they do not collide with each other, if one of your pucks falls out at the bottom of the arena, the game is over. The goal is to get the highest amount of points. Good luck!</p>
	<h4>Specifics and mechanics of the game</h4>
		<p>The handle will never leave the canvas of the game, and cannot go pass the dark grey line at the top of the board. There are 3 status of the game, the starting screen, the game, and the ending screen. When the restart button is pressed, the game will resume instantly (it will not lead you to the start screen). The balls always start at the upper half of the arena;however the X coordinates are randomly (to be exact they are not random, the X coordinate is changing in the background). The score is on the top left of the arena, it will display how many points you have. The balls do not collide with each other. The ball will be hit in the direction you move the handle to hit the puck;however, the amount of force used will not determine the speed the puck will travel at. The pucks have two X speeds, 4 and 5, and the pucks have a set Y speed of 6 which will not be affected when hit by the handle unless when it is scored in the net: the speedY will increase by 1. </p>
