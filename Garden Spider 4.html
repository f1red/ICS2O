	<h1><strong>First time setup</strong></h1>
		<h1>Connecting to the network</h1> 
			<p>You have to have a network to connect to the internet. You will need a service provider to do this. An exmaple would be Bell. Bell has othe largest fiber optic network in Canada (fiber optics are extremely efficient at sending light signals; therefore fast connections). Most service providers, like Bell, will do everything for you. All that is needed is Cory calls Bell, and they will book an appoitment with him. They will set up the internet and wifi. After this, he will be able to connect wirelessly by wifi or wired by ethernet cord. This also permits easy sharing of documents within devices connected to the network. Bell's Home Hub 2000 can be used to share files. This will be found when he opens "computer" on the start menu. However, a storage device must be connected to the Home Hub to share files. Anything works such as a USB stick. <br> <img src="http://support.bell.ca/styles/internet/all_languages/all_regions/catalog_images/medium/enhanced/HOME_HUB_2000_BLK_34L_220X202.jpg"> </p>
