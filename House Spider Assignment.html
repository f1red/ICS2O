<p> My name is Kai. It is my second year in highschool. This is going to be the first web page I made. It seems pretty simple and easy; however, my web page is very plain. </p>
	<h3> My interests </h3>
<p style="font-family:comic sans MS;"> In the summer I enjoy going for bike rides. I usually swim whenever I can. I am currently taking WSI part 2, which is a course that is 7 hours long; which, I find is too long for one day. My favourite subjects in school are math and science. I am not sure if I am going to enjoy this course, computer science, yet. I believe I will because I do have a strong interest in computers and technology. </p>
<p> I love listening to music in my free time. I can play the piano and the guitar.&#9835 &#9835 </p>
<p style="color:blue;"> My favourite color is blue. </p>
<p style="color:brown;"> My least favourite color is brown. </p>
