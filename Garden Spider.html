		<h1>Booting</h1>
			<p> The bios and windows and everything to boot up the computer should be already and installed and set up for you. The first initial could take a while as it is the first time the computer is setting up. All that is required is that Cory sets up his windows account, which uses rather hotmail or outlook; both, by Microsoft. He should follow the steps given when setting up. The steps are simple such as asking for your name and creating your password and/or pin number to access your account and the computer. Nothing should be complicated as there are already given steps to follow. <img src="https://www.howtogeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/img_542c294a4e752.png"> </p>
