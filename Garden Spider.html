			<p> The bios and windows and everything to boot up the computer should be already and installed and set up for you. All that is required is that Cory sets up his windows account, which uses rather hotmail or outlook; both, by Microsoft. He should follow the steps given when setting up. The steps are simple such as asking for your name and creating your password and/or pin number to access your account and the computer.</p>
