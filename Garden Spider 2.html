	<h1><strong>First time setup</strong></h1>
		<h1>Added Peripherals</h1>
			<p>The peripheraels will have to be connected to the computer. It is all wired. The monitor will be connect via an HDMI to the dedicated graphics card. The mouse, headphone, and keyboard will be connected to the computer (preferably the back) via USB. The drivers should be downloaded automatically upon connecting it to the computer. The computer will have wired internet connecting his router to the back of his computer. However, a wireless adapter can be added if wanted. If Cory decides to switch to a wireless mouse and keyboard there will be a small USB inside the mouse and keyboard. It works the same as wired, he needs to insert the USB to the USB ports at the back or the front of his computer. Batteries will be required for the keyboard and mouse. He can also add a printer if he wishes. The printer will come with a cord that will have a USB end that goes into his computer. The drivers should download automatically, if not he needs to visit the manufactuere's websites for information.</p>
