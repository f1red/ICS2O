<h2>Alienware Area 51</h2>

	<h2>Alienware 17</h2>
<img src="http://blogswin.blob.core.windows.net/win/sites/2/2013/07/Alienware_2D00_17_2D00_Front_2D00_Reflection_2D00_1200_5F00_74014EC9.jpg" style="width:369px;">
<p>The Alienware 51 is almost twice as powerful as the Alienware Laptop 17. However, it is not portable and is extremely expensive. The Alienware Laptop 17 is portable and does not require a keyboard or mouse; however, it is recommended that we purchase one. Looking at today's modern games. It is not necessary to have a PC as power as the Alienware Area 51, unless we are playing the best games at maximum graphics at a 8K resolution. However, that is not the case. </p>
<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p>The better buy for preformance would be the Alienware Area 51. It is powerful enough for VR for a few more years. However, if Cory likes the convience of a portable PC which a reasonable amount of preformance, he can purchase the Alienware 17 Laptop. A monitor, keyboard, mouse and headphone would be required with the desktop, but only a headphone is required if he buys the laptop.</p>
